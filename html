  <h1> Coleman Epperson </h1>
  <p> I am a part-time Software Development student while simultaneously working for UPS. </p>
  <p> I live and work in Knoxville, TN. I have lived here the majority of my life and think East Tennessee will always be what I consider home. </p>
  // about me // 
  <h2> About Me </h2>
  <p> Web Development interests me because of the versitility of the skill and the careers options that go hand in hand with said skills. Outside of Web Develpoment my interests mostly inculding golf, traveling and spending time with my buddies. </p>
  <p> I also have competed and traveled as a Professional Spikeball Player for the last few years, but looking like I'm going to put that on back burner while working my program and pursuing this new career. </p>
