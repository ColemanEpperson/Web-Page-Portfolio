        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Web Development interests me because of the versitility of the skill and the careers options associated with said skills. Outside of Web Develpoment my interests mostly inculude playing golf, traveling and spending time with my buddies.</p>
        <p>I have also competed and traveled as a Professional Spikeball Player for the last few years, but looking like I'm going to put that on back burner while working through my program and pursuing this new career.</p>
